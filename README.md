## Configuration

### GitHub API Token
To avoid hitting GitHub's API rate limits, you can provide a personal access token.
Create a token with no special permissions needed and set it in the launcher settings.
You can create a token at ```GitHub Settings -> Developer settings > Personal access tokens > Tokens (classic) > Generate new token```
You don't need to give it any special permissions. Then paste that Token into your Settings field. Do not share your Token!

### games.json Structure

The launcher uses a `games.json` file to manage the available games. You can customize this file to add your own games or modify existing entries. The file is organized into three categories: `standard`, `experimental`, and `custom`.

#### Game Entry Properties

Each game entry requires the following properties:

- **`name`** - The display name of the game as it appears in the launcher
- **`repository`** - The GitHub repository in the format `username/repository`
- **`folderName`** - The folder name where the game will be downloaded and installed
- **`gameIconUrl`** URL of the game's icon image. If null, a default icon will be used.

#### Example Configuration

```json
{
    "standard": [
        {
            "name": "Example Game",
            "repository": "username/example-game-repo",
            "folderName": "ExampleGame",
            "gameIconUrl": null
        },
        {
            "name": "Another Game",
            "repository": "anotheruser/another-game-repo",
            "folderName": "AnotherGame",
            "gameIconUrl": "link/to/an/image.png"
        }
    ],
    "experimental": [
        {
